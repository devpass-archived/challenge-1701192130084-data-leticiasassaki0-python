## Data Structures Challenge in Python

### Challenge Description
Implement a Python class `Stack` that represents a stack data structure. This challenge focuses on working with data structures in Python.

### Setup and Execution
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Run tests using `python -m unittest test_main.py`.
- Implement your solution in `main.py`.

### Task
- Your `Stack` class should include the following methods:
  - `__init__(self)`: Initializes an empty stack.
  - `push(self, item)`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
  - `pop(self)`: Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
  - `peek(self)`: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
  - `is_empty(self)`: Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
- Ensure your implementation handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
